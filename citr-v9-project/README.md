## Complete Intro to React, v9 Course

This is a companion repository for the [Complete Intro to React, v9][fem] course on Frontend Masters.
[![Frontend Masters](https://static.frontendmasters.com/assets/brand/logos/full.png)][fem]

## About this Repository

Every step of the project built throughout the course will have a folder that will be a snapshot of the current state of the project. The naming format will be `XX-<name of the lesson>` so you can get a rough idea of order and which lesson the step is coming from. In each snapshot you'll have to run `npm install` again since they are another whole copy of the project.

## Setup Instructions

We recommend using `Node.js version 20` with this course. The project will be built from scratch so most of the folders in this repo are just for reference. Later in the course, the `api` directory will be used to simulate an API server. To get set up, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/btholt/citr-v9-project.git
```

To use the version of node this course was built with:

- with [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm), `fnm use --install-if-missing`
- with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), `nvm install`
